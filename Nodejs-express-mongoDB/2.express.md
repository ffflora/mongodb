Express is a Web application framework that provides a robust set of features.

### Install Express:

In project folder, do:

`npm install express --save`

`--save` 可以省掉手动修改 *package.json* 文件的步骤

------

### REST:

Web services, there are two common approaches:

SOAP and REST

REST concepts:

- Nouns(resources): unconstrained
  - `https://www.conFusion.food/dishes/123`
- Verbs: constrained
  - i.e., GET, PUT, POST, DELETE
- Representations: constrained
  - i.e., XML, JSON

Naming Resources:

- REST uses URI to identify resources
- As you traverse the path from more genetic to more specific, you are navigating the data
- Directory structure to identify resources

Verbs:

- **HTTP GET --- READ** 
  - Used to request  for information 
  - Transfer the data from the server to the client in some representation(XML, JSON) 
- **HTTP POST --- CREATE**
  - create a resource
  - `POST http://www.conFusion.food/feedback`
    - content: {first name, last name, email, comment etc.}
    - create a new feedback with given properties.
- **HTTP PUT --- UPDATE**
  - update a resource
  - `PUT  http://www.conFusion.food/dishes/123`
    - content: {name, image, description, comments,...}
    - updates the info. about the dish, e.g, comments.
- HTTP DELETE --- DELETE
  - `DELETE http://www.conFusion.food/dishes/456`

#### Stateless Server:

- Server should not track the client state: every request is a new request from the client.
- Client should track its own state:
  - using cookies, client side database, etc 
  - every request must include sufficient info for server to serve up the requested info
  - Client-side MVC setup

##### URI v.s. URL:

> A **URI** can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both. The term “Uniform Resource Locator” (**URL**) refers to the subset of **URIs** that, in addition to identifying a resource, provide a means of locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism (e.g., 
> its network “location”).



### <u>Express Router:</u>

##### Body  Parser:

`var bodyParser = require('body-parser');`

`app.use(bodyParser.json()); //parse the json in the body`

##### Express Router 

It creates a mini-Express application:

`var dishRouter = express.Router();`

`dishRouter.use(bodyParser.json());`

`dishRouter.route('/')`

​		`.all(...);`

​		`.get(...);`

​		`...`

### Express Generator 

Quick scaffolding tool to generate an Express application skeleton

Install:

`npm install express-generator -g` 

#### How does Express Generator work?

`express <App Name>` 

- generates a folder under current folder with the name <App Name/> 
- various options available

Then, move to the current folder and install the node modules

```nodejs
express conFusionServer
cd conFusionServer 
npm install
```



Generated Application

- app.js: starting
- package.json
- public: static resources
- routes: application routes
- views: template engine
